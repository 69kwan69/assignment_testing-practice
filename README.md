# Assignment: Testing Practice

This is the solution to the project assigned by TheOdinProject. For more information, please refer to [their curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice).

## Content

There are 2 main files in this solution. One is `functions.js`, which contains all the functions corresponding to all the random questions of the assignment. The other is `functions.test.js`, which contains some test cases for each function in the `functions.js` that should be passed successfully.

## Installation Guide

There's nothing worth installing. But I would put it here just in case.

1. Clone and install required packages to local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/69kwan69/assignment_testing-practice.git
cd ./assignment_testing-practice
npm install
```

2. Run

```bash
npm run test
```

## Note

If you made it to here and having the intention to read my code, then don't. It's cringe. I can't even read my code. I just did this for the sake of doing it.
